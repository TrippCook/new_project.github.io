	<p>Welcome to my personal website, where I will wax poetic on all things cultural. <a href="about_me.html">Click here for my brief bio.</a></p>

	<h2>Blog Post April 7, 2009: <em>Street Art and Capitalism</em></h2>
	<p>I had dinner and hung around L5P after work tonight. I really like the street art that Atlanta has to offer, like in the area of the Krog St underpass, and this area has some of the best in town. While in L5P, I came across a couple of notable examples of graffiti that come from completely opposite ends of the "Genuine spectrum." The first I came across is this one:</p>
	<img src="assets/images/5thdoor.jpg" width="40%" alt="5th Door promo mural">
	<p>It is at the end of a handicap parking space, so it will almost always be seen. It features a logo that says "the 5th Door", and even features its own website. At the bottom, it says "Brought to you by the 2009 Toyota Matrix." In Little Five Points. By a graffiti artist. Toyota certainly gets points for something, but being genuine isn't it.</p>
	<p>But then, I felt a lot better about things. I came across this one.</p>
	<img src="assets/images/AIG.jpg" width="40%" alt="AIG mural by Never">
	<p>It is of a line of men reaching out toward the viewer. They are extending cups, as in a request for you to give them money. They look down and out, homeless, but not scary. Written on the side of the cups is the AIG logo. Is it easier to get a handout if you are a multinational than simply the bottom of the pyramid? What if the pyramid flipped? Are some people living lives on the margin because of tough personal situations and others because of widespread collective myopia? Anyway, great commentary. </p>
